Learning-Journal

 Welcome to my Deep Learning blogs & git repo.. This is dedicated to those who are starting a learning journey on Computer Vision and Deep Learning.

 While Images, Art, Animation are the focus here, we will digress periodically to look at other data sets, especially LLMs.
 

 At the outset, I want to call out a few people, resources that continue inspire me:

  - Andrej Karpaty (of course): https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy
    - Been following his work, from the  Computer Vision Stanford letures to his latest (see & subscribe to his YouTube)

  - Hugging Face: easily the best way to work with DL models; more at https://huggingface.co/



Note: Quite a few of the notebooks are borrowed & reproduced here from various sources, for convenient contextual access, and if any attributes are missing, please do call out.
